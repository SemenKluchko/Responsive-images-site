In this case I create a site and use next features:
- background and scaling image, pixel density logotype;
- responsive images (hero image, simple image for paragraph and many else) with different sizes/similar sizes, using media queries, 
picture tag, and srcset attribute;
- add a lazy load image gallery create by https://github.com/verlok/lazyload ;
- add a slick slider create by https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick ;
- last min version of jquery;
